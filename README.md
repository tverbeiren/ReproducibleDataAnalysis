# A Shot at Reproducible Data Analysis

## What?

This project gives an overview of one approach to reproducible research based on data and with the aim to export to different output formats, including a good-looking PDF. Even if the latter is a matter of personal taste...

I created this as part of a presentation. Beware that the slides contain way too much text. They are meant as a proof of concept, rather than proper slides.

The things used in this project are from different places on the web. More information can be found in the several renditions of RR.

Some things are left out of the repo. The custom stylesheet for the PDF, for instance.
